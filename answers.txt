•  Why should you have different branches?
	The code in the main branch will be the working version. Making changes every time on the main code may affect the working code. If there is any changes we make on the code as a trial and error method, then it will affect the working code. So we need to create other sub branches from the main branch to avoid unnecessary changes to the main branch. After testing the test branches we can merge it to the main branch if everything works good.
